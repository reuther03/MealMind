#  Performance Nutrition for Athletes

A focused guide on fueling athletic performance through **carb cycling**, **intra-workout nutrition**, and **recovery strategies** to optimize energy, endurance, and adaptation.

---

##  Core Principles

Athletic nutrition aims to **match energy intake with output** — providing the right fuel at the right time.

1. **Fuel for performance** → Carbs before and during exercise.
2. **Recover efficiently** → Protein + carbs after training.
3. **Adapt over time** → Periodize intake with training load (carb cycling).
4. **Stay hydrated** → Replace fluids and electrolytes lost in sweat.

##  Carb Cycling Explained

Carb cycling adjusts carbohydrate intake based on training intensity and recovery needs.

| Day Type | Goal | Carb Intake (per kg) | Example Focus |
|-----------|------|----------------------|----------------|
| **High-intensity / competition** | Maximize performance | 5–7 g/kg | High-carb meals and snacks |
| **Moderate training** | Support energy, recovery | 3–5 g/kg | Balanced intake through the day |
| **Rest / light training** | Aid recovery, avoid excess | 2–3 g/kg | Focus on protein, healthy fats, veggies |

 Adjust fats inversely to carbs: higher carbs → lower fats, and vice versa.

##  Pre-Workout Nutrition

**Goal:** Optimize energy and focus for performance.

| Timing | Focus | Example Meals |
|---------|--------|----------------|
| **2–3 hrs before** | Carbs + lean protein | Rice with chicken and veggies, oatmeal with whey and banana |
| **30–60 min before** | Quick-digesting carbs | Banana, sports drink, rice cakes |

 Avoid high-fat or high-fiber meals right before training to prevent GI distress.

##  Intra-Workout Fuel

**Goal:** Sustain energy and delay fatigue during long or intense sessions.

| Duration | Recommendation |
|-----------|----------------|
| **<60 min** | Water is sufficient |
| **60–90 min** | 30–45 g carbs/hour (e.g., sports drink, gels, or chews) |
| **>90 min** | 45–75 g carbs/hour + electrolytes |

 Combine **glucose + fructose** sources for better absorption.  
 Maintain fluid intake: **~500–1000 ml/hour** depending on sweat rate.

##  Post-Workout Recovery

**Goal:** Replenish glycogen and rebuild muscle.

| Nutrient | Recommendation | Example |
|-----------|----------------|----------|
| **Carbs** | 1.0–1.5 g per kg (within 1–2 hrs) | Rice, pasta, oats, fruit |
| **Protein** | 20–40 g high-quality | Whey shake, chicken, eggs |
| **Fluids** | 1.5x fluid lost in training | Water + electrolytes |

 Add a bit of sodium to meals/drinks to improve rehydration.

##  Recovery Enhancers

| Strategy | Benefit |
|-----------|----------|
| **Sleep (7–9 hrs)** | Boosts hormone balance and muscle repair. |
| **Omega-3s** | Reduce inflammation and aid recovery. |
| **Antioxidant-rich foods** | Support immune function (berries, spinach, beets). |
| **Magnesium & electrolytes** | Prevent cramps and promote relaxation. |

##  Key Takeaways

1. Periodize carbs — **fuel hard on hard days**, rest on light ones.  
2. Pre- and post-workout meals are **non-negotiable** for athletes.  
3. Stay **hydrated and electrolyte-balanced** before, during, and after sessions.  
4. Recovery = training + nutrition + sleep.  
5. Small daily habits add up — consistency beats intensity.
