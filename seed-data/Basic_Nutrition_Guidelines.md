# Basic Nutrition Guidelines

A simple evidence-based reference for daily nutrition, including protein, fats, and carbohydrate needs — split by
activity level.

##  General Principles

- **Calories** determine body weight changes:
    - **Surplus** → gain weight / muscle
    - **Deficit** → lose weight / fat
- **Macronutrients** (protein, carbs, fat) determine *how* that weight changes.
- **Micronutrients** (vitamins, minerals, fiber, etc.) determine *how healthy* you are while changing it.

##  Protein

| Category                                  | Recommended Intake                | Purpose                                   |
|-------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| **Sedentary / average person**            | **0.8–1.0 g per kg of body mass** | Maintains muscle and tissue health        |
| **Active person / recreational exercise** | **1.2–1.6 g per kg**              | Supports recovery and muscle maintenance  |
| **Strength or hypertrophy training**      | **1.6–2.2 g per kg**              | Maximizes muscle growth and repair        |
| **Cutting phase (fat loss)**              | **2.0–2.4 g per kg**              | Preserves lean mass under calorie deficit |

 Aim to spread protein across **3–5 meals** per day.  
 Prefer **complete protein sources**: eggs, meat, fish, dairy, soy, or blended plant proteins.

##  Fats

| Category                         | Recommended Intake   | Purpose                                            |
|----------------------------------|----------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| **General health**               | **0.8–1.0 g per kg** | Hormone production, brain health                   |
| **Athletes / strength training** | **0.6–1.0 g per kg** | Energy and nutrient absorption                     |
| **Cutting phase**                | **0.5–0.8 g per kg** | Lower fat to save calories, but not below 0.5 g/kg |

 Focus on **unsaturated fats** (olive oil, avocados, nuts, fatty fish).  
 Limit trans fats and excessive processed vegetable oils.

##  Carbohydrates

| Category                          | Recommended Intake | Purpose                                                 |
|-----------------------------------|--------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| **Sedentary / light activity**    | **2–3 g per kg**   | Baseline energy and brain function                      |
| **Moderate exercise (3–5x/week)** | **3–5 g per kg**   | Energy for training and recovery                        |
| **Heavy training or endurance**   | **5–7 g per kg**   | Primary fuel for performance and glycogen replenishment |

 Prefer **complex carbs** (rice, oats, whole grains, fruit, veggies).  
 Adjust carb intake depending on training intensity and calorie goals.

## Micronutrients & Hydration

| Category                  | Recommendation                                                          |
|---------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Water**                 | ~30–40 ml per kg of body mass daily (e.g. 2–3 L for most adults)        |
| **Sodium / electrolytes** | Don’t restrict unless medically necessary, especially if sweating a lot |
| **Fiber**                 | 25–35 g per day                                                         |
| **Vitamins & minerals**   | Eat diverse fruits, vegetables, and whole foods daily                   |

Supplement *only if deficient* (common: vitamin D, magnesium, omega-3, B12 for vegetarians).

##  Key Takeaways

1. **Prioritize protein** for body composition.
2. **Balance fats** for hormones and brain health.
3. **Adjust carbs** to match activity and energy demands.
4. **Hydrate well**, eat colorful plants, and sleep enough.
5. Consistency > perfection.
