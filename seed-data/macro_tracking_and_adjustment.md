#  Macro Tracking and Adjustment

A practical guide to **tracking macronutrients** (protein, carbs, and fats) and **adjusting intake** based on real-world progress — for muscle gain, fat loss, or maintenance.

---

##  Step 1: Understand the Macros

| Macronutrient | Calories per gram | Main Role |
|----------------|------------------|------------|
| **Protein** | 4 kcal | Builds and repairs tissue, preserves muscle mass |
| **Carbohydrates** | 4 kcal | Main energy source for training and brain function |
| **Fats** | 9 kcal | Hormone production, cell health, and nutrient absorption |

 Alcohol has 7 kcal/g but isn’t a macronutrient.

##  Step 2: Set Your Starting Macros

Base your intake on your **TDEE** (Total Daily Energy Expenditure) and goal:

| Goal | Protein | Carbs | Fats | Example Split |
|------|----------|--------|------|----------------|
| **Fat Loss** | 2.0–2.4 g/kg | 2–4 g/kg | 0.5–0.8 g/kg | 35P / 40C / 25F |
| **Muscle Gain** | 1.6–2.2 g/kg | 4–6 g/kg | 0.8–1.0 g/kg | 25P / 55C / 20F |
| **Maintenance** | 1.6–2.0 g/kg | 3–5 g/kg | 0.8–1.0 g/kg | 30P / 45C / 25F |

 Start with these targets for 2–3 weeks before making changes.

##  Step 3: Track Your Intake

| Tool | Description |
|------|--------------|
| **Apps** | MyFitnessPal, Cronometer, MacroFactor, Yazio |
| **Manual method** | Log meals with kitchen scale and nutrition labels |

 Track **protein and calories** most closely — they have the biggest impact.  
 Allow a margin of error (~5–10%) — perfection isn’t required.

---

##  Step 4: Evaluate Progress

Track your data weekly:

| Metric | How to Measure | Goal Trend |
|---------|----------------|-------------|
| **Body weight** | Morning, fasted, 3x/week average | Stable for maintenance, up for gain, down for loss |
| **Body composition** | Photos, tape measure, mirror | Visible change every 2–4 weeks |
| **Performance** | Strength, endurance, recovery | Maintain or improve over time |
| **Energy & hunger** | Subjective feedback | Stable and manageable |

 Make only one change at a time and reassess after 10–14 days.

---

##  Step 5: Adjust Macros Based on Results

| Scenario | Adjustment Strategy |
|-----------|--------------------|
| **No weight change (2+ weeks)** | Increase or decrease calories by 150–200/day |
| **Too fast fat loss (>1% BW/week)** | Add 150–200 kcal/day, mostly carbs/fats |
| **Too slow fat loss (<0.25% BW/week)** | Reduce 150–200 kcal/day, usually carbs |
| **Muscle gain too fast (>1 kg/month)** | Reduce +100–200 kcal/day, mainly carbs/fats |
| **Low energy / poor recovery** | Add carbs or fats to improve performance |

 Keep protein constant — adjust carbs and fats for calorie changes.

---

##  Step 6: Use Adaptive Tracking

As you lose or gain weight, your **TDEE changes**. Recalculate every 3–5 kg or monthly:
- **Fat loss phase:** metabolism adapts ↓ → lower intake needed over time.  
- **Muscle gain:** higher weight → higher calorie needs.

 Dynamic tracking prevents stalls or excessive gain.

---

##  Advanced Tips

1. **Carb cycling** – raise carbs on training days, lower them on rest days.  
2. **Refeed days** – occasional high-carb days to restore glycogen & hormones.  
3. **Diet breaks** – 1–2 weeks at maintenance to reset metabolism during long cuts.  
4. **Macro flexibility** – focus on weekly averages, not daily perfection.  
5. **Meal consistency** – eating similar foods simplifies tracking and accuracy.

---

##  Key Takeaways

1. Macros are adjustable levers — not fixed rules.  
2. Track progress weekly and make **small, data-driven tweaks**.  
3. Keep protein high and steady across all goals.  
4. Adapt macros with changing activity, goals, or body composition.  
5. Long-term success = consistency + gradual refinement.
