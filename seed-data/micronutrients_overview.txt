- Vitamin: Vitamin E | Function: Antioxidant, skin protection | Deficiency Symptoms: Muscle weakness, nerve issues | Best Sources: Nuts, seeds, vegetable oils, spinach
- Vitamin: Vitamin K | Function: Blood clotting, bone metabolism | Deficiency Symptoms: Easy bruising, bleeding | Best Sources: Kale, broccoli, Brussels sprouts

Minerals

- Mineral: Calcium | Function: Bone strength, nerve signaling | Deficiency Symptoms: Weak bones, muscle cramps | Best Sources: Dairy, tofu, leafy greens, sardines
- Mineral: Iron | Function: Oxygen transport, energy | Deficiency Symptoms: Fatigue, pale skin, shortness of breath | Best Sources: Red meat, lentils, spinach, fortified cereals
- Mineral: Magnesium | Function: Muscle & nerve function, enzyme activity | Deficiency Symptoms: Muscle cramps, anxiety, poor sleep | Best Sources: Nuts, seeds, whole grains, dark chocolate
- Mineral: Zinc | Function: Immune function, wound healing | Deficiency Symptoms: Poor healing, hair loss, low immunity | Best Sources: Meat, shellfish, pumpkin seeds, beans
- Mineral: Potassium | Function: Muscle contraction, fluid balance | Deficiency Symptoms: Fatigue, cramps, irregular heartbeat | Best Sources: Bananas, potatoes, beans, avocados
- Mineral: Sodium | Function: Fluid balance, nerve function | Deficiency Symptoms: Dizziness, low blood pressure | Best Sources: Salt, soups, pickled foods (in moderation)
- Mineral: Iodine | Function: Thyroid hormone production | Deficiency Symptoms: Goiter, fatigue, weight gain | Best Sources: Iodized salt, seafood, dairy
- Mineral: Selenium | Function: Antioxidant, thyroid function | Deficiency Symptoms: Weak immunity, fatigue | Best Sources: Brazil nuts, fish, eggs, brown rice
- Mineral: Phosphorus | Function: Bone structure, energy metabolism | Deficiency Symptoms: Weak muscles, poor appetite | Best Sources: Meat, dairy, nuts, beans
- Mineral: Copper | Function: Red blood cell production, iron absorption | Deficiency Symptoms: Fatigue, weak immunity | Best Sources: Shellfish, nuts, seeds, whole grains

Electrolytes & Hydration Minerals

- Nutrient: Sodium (Na) | Role: Maintains fluid balance | Signs of Imbalance: Low: fatigue, cramps / High: bloating, high BP | Common Sources: Salt, soups, sports drinks
- Nutrient: Potassium (K) | Role: Nerve and muscle function | Signs of Imbalance: Irregular heartbeat, weakness | Common Sources: Bananas, potatoes, spinach
- Nutrient: Magnesium (Mg) | Role: Muscle relaxation, energy | Signs of Imbalance: Cramps, anxiety, insomnia | Common Sources: Nuts, dark chocolate, greens
- Nutrient: Calcium (Ca) | Role: Nerve signaling, bone health | Signs of Imbalance: Numbness, cramps | Common Sources: Dairy, fortified plant milk

Supplement Notes

- Supplement only if deficiency or medical advice suggests it.
- Common helpful supplements: Vitamin D, Omega-3, Magnesium, B12 (for vegans).
- Whole foods are still the best primary source of micronutrients.

Key Takeaways

1. Eat a colorful, varied diet for micronutrient diversity.
2. Deficiencies are often linked to low variety or restrictive diets.
3. Pair fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, K) with healthy fats for absorption.
4. Don’t over-supplement — balance matters.
5. Micronutrients power everything from energy to immunity.

Added Notes:
- Vitamin K2 (found in fermented foods and eggs) complements vitamin D for bone health.
- Pair non-heme iron (from plants) with vitamin C to improve absorption.
- Chronic low intake of magnesium and potassium contributes to fatigue; monitor if training intensely.
- Zinc competes with copper for absorption; avoid long-term high-dose zinc supplementation.
