Muscle Gain Nutrition

A practical guide to building muscle through a structured caloric surplus, balanced macronutrient ratios, and consistent meal planning.

The Goal: Controlled Surplus

To gain lean muscle, you need a caloric surplus — eating slightly more calories than your body burns.

- Goal: Beginner | Surplus: +300–500 kcal/day | Expected Weight Gain: 0.5–1.0 kg/month
- Goal: Intermediate/Advanced | Surplus: +200–300 kcal/day | Expected Weight Gain: 0.25–0.5 kg/month

 Slow, steady gain = more muscle, less fat.
 Large surpluses often lead to excessive fat gain.

Macronutrient Ratios
Protein
- 1.6–2.2 g per kg body weight
- Builds and repairs muscle tissue.
Carbohydrates
- 4–6 g per kg body weight
- Primary energy source for intense training.
Fats
- 0.8–1.0 g per kg body weight
- Supports hormones, brain function, and recovery.
Example (for 75 kg person)
- Nutrient: Protein | Amount: 150 g | Calories: 600 kcal
- Nutrient: Carbs | Amount: 375 g | Calories: 1500 kcal
- Nutrient: Fats | Amount: 70 g | Calories: 630 kcal
- Nutrient: Total | Amount: — | Calories: ~2730 kcal/day

Meal Timing & Frequency

- Time: Breakfast | Focus: Carbs + protein | Example Meal: Oats, milk, banana, whey
- Time: Lunch | Focus: Balanced meal | Example Meal: Rice, chicken, veggies, olive oil
- Time: Pre-workout | Focus: Energy + easy digestion | Example Meal: Rice cakes, fruit, yogurt
- Time: Post-workout | Focus: Recovery meal | Example Meal: Whey shake + banana
- Time: Dinner | Focus: Protein + complex carbs | Example Meal: Salmon, sweet potato, broccoli
- Time: Snack (optional) | Focus: Calorie top-up | Example Meal: Nuts, cottage cheese, smoothie

 Spread protein across 3–5 meals/day.
 Eat a carb-heavy meal before and after workouts.

Food Quality Matters

- Choose whole, nutrient-dense foods (meat, fish, grains, fruit, dairy, nuts).
- Use liquid calories (smoothies, milk, shakes) if appetite is low.
- Avoid excessive junk food — quality matters for recovery and health.

Tracking & Adjustments

1. Track your body weight 2–3× per week (morning, fasted).
2. If you’re not gaining → increase calories by 150–200 kcal/day.
3. If you’re gaining too quickly (>1 kg/week) → reduce by 200–300 kcal/day.
4. Reassess every 2–3 weeks.

Example 1-Day Muscle Gain Plan (2700 kcal)

- Meal: Breakfast | Example: Oats with milk, berries, whey, almonds | Calories: 600
- Meal: Snack | Example: Greek yogurt with banana | Calories: 300
- Meal: Lunch | Example: Chicken, rice, olive oil, veggies | Calories: 650
- Meal: Post-Workout | Example: Whey shake + banana | Calories: 250
- Meal: Dinner | Example: Salmon, potatoes, broccoli | Calories: 600
- Meal: Snack (before bed) | Example: Cottage cheese + peanut butter | Calories: 300
- Meal: Total | Example: — | Calories: ~2700 kcal

Key Takeaways

1. Eat in a small, consistent surplus (200–500 kcal above maintenance).
2. Prioritize protein and carbs for muscle growth.
3. Train progressively — nutrition amplifies training, not replaces it.
4. Track progress and adjust intake as you adapt.
5. Sleep, hydration, and recovery are equally critical for muscle gain.

Added Notes:
- Protein distribution: target 0.3 g/kg per meal across 4–6 feedings.
- Use intra-workout carbs for sessions >90 minutes.
- Maintain at least 30 g fiber/day even during surplus to aid digestion.
- Regularly deload training to manage recovery and avoid appetite suppression.
