# 💪 Fat Loss Nutrition

A practical, evidence-based guide to losing fat through a **calorie deficit**, managing **hunger and satiety**, and avoiding **common dieting mistakes**.

## ⚖️ The Goal: Sustainable Calorie Deficit

Fat loss occurs only when you consistently consume **fewer calories than you burn**. The aim is a **moderate, sustainable deficit** — not starvation.

| Goal | Calorie Deficit | Expected Fat Loss |
|------|------------------|--------------------|
| **Moderate (recommended)** | 15–25% below maintenance | 0.5–1.0% of body weight per week |
| **Aggressive (short term)** | 25–35% below maintenance | Faster loss, higher fatigue & muscle risk |

✅ Small, steady progress preserves muscle and energy.  
⚠️ Extreme restriction often leads to rebound weight gain.

## 🍽️ Macronutrient Ratios

### 🥩 **Protein**
- **2.0–2.4 g per kg body weight**
- Preserves lean muscle during deficit, improves satiety.

### 🥑 **Fats**
- **0.5–0.8 g per kg body weight**
- Supports hormones and brain function.

### 🍚 **Carbohydrates**
- **2–4 g per kg body weight** (adjust to activity)
- Fuels training performance and recovery.

✅ Keep protein high, moderate carbs, and control fats for calorie flexibility.

## 🍔 Managing Hunger & Satiety

| Strategy | Description |
|-----------|--------------|
| **Eat high-volume foods** | Focus on vegetables, soups, fruit, and lean proteins. |
| **Prioritize protein** | Slows digestion and keeps you full longer. |
| **Drink water regularly** | Dehydration can feel like hunger. |
| **Choose whole foods** | Fiber and low energy density improve fullness. |
| **Sleep 7–9 hours** | Lack of sleep increases appetite hormones (ghrelin). |

✅ Slow eating and mindful meals also reduce overeating.

## 💡 Common Pitfalls

| Mistake | Consequence | Fix |
|----------|--------------|-----|
| **Overestimating calorie burn** | Slower fat loss | Track food intake and activity honestly. |
| **Cutting calories too low** | Fatigue, muscle loss | Keep deficit moderate; maintain protein. |
| **Neglecting strength training** | Muscle loss, slower metabolism | Lift weights 2–4x/week. |
| **Weekend overeating** | Erases weekly deficit | Track consistently, even on weekends. |
| **Overreliance on supplements** | Wasted money | Prioritize real food and proper sleep. |

## 🏃 Pre- and Post-Workout Nutrition (in Deficit)

| Timing | Focus | Example |
|---------|--------|----------|
| **Pre-workout** | Energy & focus | Banana, Greek yogurt, coffee |
| **Post-workout** | Recovery | Whey + fruit; chicken + rice |

✅ Keep workouts fueled to preserve muscle and strength.

## 📈 Example Day (2000 kcal)

| Meal | Example | Calories |
|------|----------|-----------|
| **Breakfast** | Scrambled eggs, toast, spinach | 400 |
| **Snack** | Protein shake + apple | 200 |
| **Lunch** | Chicken breast, quinoa, veggies | 500 |
| **Snack** | Greek yogurt + berries | 200 |
| **Dinner** | Salmon, broccoli, sweet potato | 550 |
| **Total** | — | **~1850–2000 kcal** |

## 🧠 Key Takeaways

1. Fat loss = consistent calorie deficit, not short-term restriction.  
2. High **protein + fiber** diets make staying full easier.  
3. Keep training hard to maintain muscle and metabolism.  
4. Don’t fear carbs — balance them around activity.  
5. Track progress (weight, photos, strength) and adjust every 2–3 weeks.
