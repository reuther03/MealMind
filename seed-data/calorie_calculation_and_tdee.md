# 🔢 Calorie Calculation & TDEE

A step-by-step, evidence-based guide to estimating **Total Daily Energy Expenditure (TDEE)** — your daily calorie needs. Multiple calculation methods are included for better accuracy and comparison.

## ⚙️ Step 1: Understand the Components of Energy Expenditure

Your total daily energy use = the sum of four parts:

| Component | Description | % of Total |
|------------|-------------|-------------|
| **BMR (Basal Metabolic Rate)** | Energy used at rest for essential functions (breathing, organs, etc.) | 60–75% |
| **TEF (Thermic Effect of Food)** | Energy used to digest and process food (~10% of calories) | 10% |
| **EAT (Exercise Activity Thermogenesis)** | Calories burned during workouts | 5–15% |
| **NEAT (Non-Exercise Activity Thermogenesis)** | Movement, walking, posture, fidgeting | 10–20% |

✅ Increasing NEAT (daily activity) can meaningfully raise TDEE without more gym time.

---

## 🧮 Step 2: Estimate Your Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR)

Here are the **three most common and accurate BMR equations**:

### 1️⃣ **Mifflin–St Jeor Equation** *(modern standard)*
```
Men:   BMR = 10 × weight (kg) + 6.25 × height (cm) – 5 × age (y) + 5  
Women: BMR = 10 × weight (kg) + 6.25 × height (cm) – 5 × age (y) – 161
```

### 2️⃣ **Harris–Benedict Equation (revised)** *(older but still useful)*
```
Men:   BMR = 13.397 × weight + 4.799 × height – 5.677 × age + 88.362  
Women: BMR = 9.247 × weight + 3.098 × height – 4.330 × age + 447.593
```

### 3️⃣ **Katch–McArdle Formula** *(best if you know body fat %)*
```
BMR = 370 + (21.6 × Lean Body Mass in kg)
```
Where:
```
Lean Body Mass = Weight × (1 – Body Fat % / 100)
```

✅ For athletes or lean individuals, **Katch–McArdle** is typically most precise.

## 🏋️ Step 3: Apply Your Activity Multiplier

Multiply your BMR by one of the following activity levels to estimate **TDEE**:

| Activity Level | Description | Multiplier |
|----------------|--------------|-------------|
| **Sedentary** | Little to no exercise | × 1.2 |
| **Lightly active** | Exercise 1–3x/week | × 1.375 |
| **Moderately active** | Exercise 3–5x/week | × 1.55 |
| **Very active** | Hard exercise 6–7x/week | × 1.725 |
| **Extra active** | Intense training + physical job | × 1.9 |

✅ TDEE = BMR × Activity Multiplier

## 📊 Step 4: Compare & Cross-Check Methods

You can average results from **2–3 methods** for higher accuracy.

**Example (30-year-old male, 75 kg, 180 cm, moderate activity)**

| Formula | BMR | TDEE |
|----------|------|------|
| **Mifflin–St Jeor** | 1,739 kcal | 2,695 kcal |
| **Harris–Benedict** | 1,782 kcal | 2,762 kcal |
| **Katch–McArdle (15% BF)** | 1,727 kcal | 2,677 kcal |

✅ **Average TDEE ≈ 2,710 kcal/day**

---

## ⚖️ Step 5: Adjust Based on Goal

| Goal | Strategy | Adjustment |
|------|-----------|-------------|
| **Muscle Gain** | Eat in a small surplus | +200–500 kcal/day |
| **Fat Loss** | Create a calorie deficit | –300–500 kcal/day |
| **Maintenance** | Match intake to TDEE | ±0 kcal |

✅ Reassess every 2–3 weeks — metabolism adapts over time.

---

## 🧠 Step 6: Validate with Real-World Tracking

1. Track **body weight trends** (same time each morning, 2–3x/week).  
2. If weight is stable → you’re at maintenance.  
3. If gaining/losing too fast → adjust calories by 100–200/day.  
4. Use **progress, energy, and training performance** to fine-tune.

## 📱 Bonus: Quick Estimation Formula (for Speed)

| Category | Shortcut Formula |
|-----------|------------------|
| **Sedentary** | Bodyweight (kg) × 28–30 |
| **Moderately active** | Bodyweight (kg) × 33–36 |
| **Very active / athlete** | Bodyweight (kg) × 38–42 |

✅ Example: 75 kg × 35 = **2,625 kcal/day (approx.)**

## 🧩 Key Takeaways

1. Use multiple TDEE methods (Mifflin–St Jeor + Katch–McArdle) for accuracy.  
2. Remember: equations give **estimates**, not exact values.  
3. Recalculate as body composition or activity changes.  
4. Long-term success depends on **tracking and adjusting**, not static formulas.  
5. Your **TDEE is dynamic** — lifestyle, NEAT, and recovery all matter.
