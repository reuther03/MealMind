# 💧 Hydration and Electrolyte Balance

A guide to understanding **how water intake, electrolytes, and physical activity interact**, and how to maintain optimal hydration for health and performance.

## 🌊 Why Hydration Matters

Water is essential for every physiological process:

- Regulates **body temperature** and sweat response.
- Supports **nutrient transport** and waste removal.
- Affects **mental clarity**, **muscle function**, and **endurance**.
- Even mild dehydration (1–2% body weight loss) can reduce strength and focus.

## 💧 Daily Water Intake Recommendations

| Activity Level | Recommended Water Intake |
|----------------|---------------------------|
| **Sedentary / light activity** | 30–35 ml per kg body weight |
| **Moderately active (3–5x/week)** | 35–40 ml per kg |
| **High training volume or hot climate** | 45–50 ml per kg |

✅ Example: A 75 kg person → ~2.5–3.5 liters daily.

⚠️ Adjust for **environment**, **diet (high protein/salt)**, and **sweat rate**.

## ⚡ Electrolytes Overview

Electrolytes are minerals that help maintain fluid balance, muscle contraction, and nerve function.

| Electrolyte | Function | Signs of Imbalance | Food Sources |
|--------------|-----------|--------------------|---------------|
| **Sodium (Na)** | Retains fluid, supports nerve signals | Low: dizziness, fatigue; High: bloating | Salt, soups, pickled foods |
| **Potassium (K)** | Fluid balance, heart rhythm | Low: cramps, irregular heartbeat | Bananas, potatoes, spinach, beans |
| **Magnesium (Mg)** | Muscle relaxation, enzyme activity | Low: cramps, poor sleep, anxiety | Nuts, seeds, dark chocolate |
| **Calcium (Ca)** | Muscle contraction, nerve function | Low: numbness, spasms | Dairy, fortified milk, tofu |
| **Chloride (Cl)** | Works with sodium for fluid balance | Rarely deficient | Table salt, seaweed |

## 🏃 Hydration During Exercise

| Duration | Recommendation |
|-----------|----------------|
| **<60 minutes (light/moderate)** | Water is sufficient; sip regularly. |
| **60–90 minutes (moderate-heavy)** | Add small electrolyte dose (pinch of salt or tablet). |
| **>90 minutes or intense heat** | Use sports drink with sodium, potassium, and carbs (6–8% solution). |

✅ Aim to **start workouts hydrated** (urine light yellow).  
✅ Rehydrate with **1.5x fluid lost** (weigh before/after training).

## 🌊 Dehydration Warning Signs

- Dark yellow urine  
- Headache or dizziness  
- Muscle cramps  
- Fatigue and irritability  
- Drop in performance or focus

If these occur, **increase fluids and electrolytes** gradually.

---

## 🧠 Practical Hydration Tips

1. **Spread water intake** evenly through the day.  
2. Use **electrolyte tablets** only when sweating heavily or training long.  
3. **Don’t overdrink** — excessive plain water without electrolytes can cause **hyponatremia**.  
4. Include **fruits and veggies** (they contain water and potassium).  
5. Adjust intake in **hot weather**, **high altitude**, or **low-carb diets** (they increase water loss).

## 🌟 Key Takeaways

- Hydration is about **balance between water and electrolytes**, not just drinking more water.  
- Listen to your body: thirst is a good baseline guide.  
- Use electrolyte support strategically — especially during long or hot training sessions.  
- Consistent hydration supports performance, focus, and recovery.
