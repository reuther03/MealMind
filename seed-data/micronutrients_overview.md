##  Supplement Notes

- Supplement **only if deficiency or medical advice** suggests it.  
- Common helpful supplements: **Vitamin D**, **Omega-3**, **Magnesium**, **B12 (for vegans)**.

##  Key Takeaways

1. Eat a **colorful, varied diet** for micronutrient diversity.  
2. Deficiencies are often linked to **low variety or restrictive diets**.  
3. Pair **fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, K)** with healthy fats for absorption.  
4. Don’t over-supplement — balance matters.  
5. Micronutrients power **everything from energy to immunity**.
