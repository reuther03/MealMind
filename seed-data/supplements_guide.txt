Key Takeaways

1. Focus on essentials first: creatine, omega-3, vitamin D, magnesium.
2. Supplements enhance results; they don’t replace nutrition or sleep.
3. Check third-party testing (e.g., NSF, Informed-Sport).
4. Start simple and monitor your response.
5. Quality, consistency, and overall diet matter most.

Added Notes:
- Always check for third-party testing (NSF, Informed Sport) for purity.
- Avoid 'proprietary blends' without dosage transparency.
- Creatine non-responders (~20%) may see limited benefit but still safe.
- Vitamin D absorption improves with a fat-containing meal.
- Cycling caffeine occasionally helps maintain sensitivity.
