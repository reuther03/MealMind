| **Dosage** | 3–5 g daily (no cycling needed) |
| **Timing** | Anytime; after training is slightly optimal |
| **Evidence level** |  (very strong) |
| **Notes** | Safe for long-term use; may cause slight water retention in muscles. |

 **Best form:** Creatine monohydrate (micronized).  
 Avoid unnecessary blends or "advanced" forms.

3. Check **third-party testing** (e.g., NSF, Informed-Sport).  
4. **Start simple** and monitor your response.  
5. Quality, consistency, and overall diet matter most.
