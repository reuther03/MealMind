Hydration and Electrolyte Balance

A guide to understanding how water intake, electrolytes, and physical activity interact, and how to maintain optimal hydration for health and performance.

Why Hydration Matters

Water is essential for every physiological process:

- Regulates body temperature and sweat response.
- Supports nutrient transport and waste removal.
- Affects mental clarity, muscle function, and endurance.
- Even mild dehydration (1–2% body weight loss) can reduce strength and focus.

Daily Water Intake Recommendations

- Activity Level: Sedentary / light activity | Recommended Water Intake: 30–35 ml per kg body weight
- Activity Level: Moderately active (3–5x/week) | Recommended Water Intake: 35–40 ml per kg
- Activity Level: High training volume or hot climate | Recommended Water Intake: 45–50 ml per kg

 Example: A 75 kg person → ~2.5–3.5 liters daily.

 Adjust for environment, diet (high protein/salt), and sweat rate.

Electrolytes Overview

Electrolytes are minerals that help maintain fluid balance, muscle contraction, and nerve function.

- Electrolyte: Sodium (Na) | Function: Retains fluid, supports nerve signals | Signs of Imbalance: Low: dizziness, fatigue; High: bloating | Food Sources: Salt, soups, pickled foods
- Electrolyte: Potassium (K) | Function: Fluid balance, heart rhythm | Signs of Imbalance: Low: cramps, irregular heartbeat | Food Sources: Bananas, potatoes, spinach, beans
- Electrolyte: Magnesium (Mg) | Function: Muscle relaxation, enzyme activity | Signs of Imbalance: Low: cramps, poor sleep, anxiety | Food Sources: Nuts, seeds, dark chocolate
- Electrolyte: Calcium (Ca) | Function: Muscle contraction, nerve function | Signs of Imbalance: Low: numbness, spasms | Food Sources: Dairy, fortified milk, tofu
- Electrolyte: Chloride (Cl) | Function: Works with sodium for fluid balance | Signs of Imbalance: Rarely deficient | Food Sources: Table salt, seaweed

Hydration During Exercise

- Duration: <60 minutes (light/moderate) | Recommendation: Water is sufficient; sip regularly.
- Duration: 60–90 minutes (moderate-heavy) | Recommendation: Add small electrolyte dose (pinch of salt or tablet).
- Duration: >90 minutes or intense heat | Recommendation: Use sports drink with sodium, potassium, and carbs (6–8% solution).

 Aim to start workouts hydrated (urine light yellow).
 Rehydrate with 1.5x fluid lost (weigh before/after training).

Dehydration Warning Signs

- Dark yellow urine
- Headache or dizziness
- Muscle cramps
- Fatigue and irritability
- Drop in performance or focus

If these occur, increase fluids and electrolytes gradually.

Practical Hydration Tips

1. Spread water intake evenly through the day.
2. Use electrolyte tablets only when sweating heavily or training long.
3. Don’t overdrink — excessive plain water without electrolytes can cause hyponatremia.
4. Include fruits and veggies (they contain water and potassium).
5. Adjust intake in hot weather, high altitude, or low-carb diets (they increase water loss).

Key Takeaways

- Hydration is about balance between water and electrolytes, not just drinking more water.
- Listen to your body: thirst is a good baseline guide.
- Use electrolyte support strategically — especially during long or hot training sessions.
- Consistent hydration supports performance, focus, and recovery.

Added Notes:
- Caffeine and alcohol have mild diuretic effects; account for them but they still contribute to total fluid intake.
- Endurance guidelines: for long efforts in heat, target ~300–800 mg sodium per hour with 0.5–1.0 L fluid depending on sweat rate.
- Morning hydration: a 300–500 ml glass after waking offsets overnight fluid loss.
