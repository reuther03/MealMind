Common Nutritional Deficiencies

A reference guide to the most frequent nutrient deficiencies, how to recognize their symptoms, and address them through diet or supplementation.

Why Deficiencies Happen

Even balanced diets can fall short on key nutrients due to:
- Limited food variety or restrictive diets (e.g., vegan, keto)
- Poor digestion or absorption issues
- Low sunlight exposure or seasonal changes
- Increased demand (training, stress, illness)

Most Common Deficiencies
1. Vitamin D
- Aspect: Function | Details: Bone health, immune system, hormone regulation
- Aspect: Deficiency Signs | Details: Fatigue, low mood, weak immunity, muscle weakness
- Aspect: Food Sources | Details: Fatty fish, eggs, fortified dairy/plant milk
- Aspect: Supplementation | Details: 1,000–2,000 IU/day (up to 4,000 IU in winter)
- Aspect: Extra Tip | Details: 15–30 min sunlight exposure helps maintain levels

2. Iron
- Aspect: Function | Details: Oxygen transport, energy metabolism
- Aspect: Deficiency Signs | Details: Fatigue, dizziness, pale skin, cold hands/feet
- Aspect: Food Sources | Details: Red meat, lentils, spinach, fortified cereals
- Aspect: Absorption Tip | Details: Pair with vitamin C (e.g., orange juice) for better absorption
- Aspect: Supplementation | Details: Only if tested and recommended — excess iron can be toxic

3. Magnesium
- Aspect: Function | Details: Muscle relaxation, sleep, nerve function
- Aspect: Deficiency Signs | Details: Muscle cramps, anxiety, insomnia, low energy
- Aspect: Food Sources | Details: Nuts, seeds, dark chocolate, leafy greens
- Aspect: Supplementation | Details: 300–400 mg/day (glycinate, citrate, or malate preferred)

4. Vitamin B12
- Aspect: Function | Details: Red blood cell production, nerve health, DNA synthesis
- Aspect: Deficiency Signs | Details: Fatigue, tingling hands/feet, brain fog
- Aspect: Food Sources | Details: Meat, fish, eggs, dairy
- Aspect: Vegan Sources | Details: Fortified plant milk, nutritional yeast, supplements
- Aspect: Supplementation | Details: 250–500 mcg/week (cyanocobalamin or methylcobalamin)

5. Calcium
- Aspect: Function | Details: Bone and teeth strength, muscle contraction, nerve signaling
- Aspect: Deficiency Signs | Details: Brittle nails, weak bones, cramps
- Aspect: Food Sources | Details: Dairy, tofu, fortified milk, leafy greens, sardines
- Aspect: Supplementation | Details: 500–1000 mg/day (split doses; better with vitamin D)

6. Zinc
- Aspect: Function | Details: Immune function, wound healing, testosterone production
- Aspect: Deficiency Signs | Details: Hair loss, poor healing, low appetite, low immunity
- Aspect: Food Sources | Details: Meat, shellfish, pumpkin seeds, chickpeas
- Aspect: Supplementation | Details: 10–20 mg/day (with food; avoid high chronic intake)

7. Omega-3 Fatty Acids (EPA/DHA)
- Aspect: Function | Details: Heart, brain, and joint health; reduces inflammation
- Aspect: Deficiency Signs | Details: Dry skin, joint stiffness, poor mood, brain fog
- Aspect: Food Sources | Details: Salmon, mackerel, sardines, chia, flaxseed
- Aspect: Supplementation | Details: 1–3 g combined EPA + DHA per day

8. Folate (Vitamin B9)
- Aspect: Function | Details: DNA synthesis, red blood cell formation
- Aspect: Deficiency Signs | Details: Fatigue, weakness, anemia
- Aspect: Food Sources | Details: Leafy greens, lentils, citrus fruits, asparagus
- Aspect: Supplementation | Details: 400 mcg/day (especially for pregnancy)

Testing & Diagnosis

- Method: Blood test (basic panel) | What It Shows: Vitamin D, iron, calcium, magnesium
- Method: Advanced test | What It Shows: Omega-3 index, zinc, B vitamins, hormone markers
- Method: Symptoms-based check | What It Shows: Useful for early detection before testing

 Always confirm suspected deficiencies with lab tests before supplementing heavily.

Prevention & Long-Term Strategies

1. Eat a diverse diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, nuts, and protein.
2. Include fortified foods if on a restricted diet (vegan, vegetarian).
3. Get regular sunlight exposure and maintain hydration.
4. Rotate food choices to cover all micronutrients.
5. Retest every 6–12 months if supplementing long term.

Key Takeaways

- Deficiencies are common even in developed diets — prevention is easier than correction.
- Combine whole foods + smart supplementation for balance.
- Track symptoms, get bloodwork, and adjust intelligently.
- Nutrient synergy matters — e.g., Vitamin D + Calcium, Iron + Vitamin C.
- The goal: optimal nutrition, not just “not deficient.”

Added Notes:
- Iodine: supports thyroid hormones; sources include iodized salt and seaweed. Both deficiency and excess can disturb thyroid function.
- Selenium: cofactor for thyroid enzymes and antioxidant defense; sources include Brazil nuts, seafood, eggs.
- Potassium: important for blood pressure control and muscle function; prioritize fruits, vegetables, potatoes, legumes; supplements only with medical guidance.
- Ferritin vs iron: low ferritin can indicate depleted iron stores even if serum iron seems normal—test before supplementing.
- B12 for vegetarians/vegans: consider regular supplementation regardless of symptoms due to limited reliable plant sources.
