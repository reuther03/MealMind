Performance Nutrition for Athletes

A focused guide on fueling athletic performance through carb cycling, intra-workout nutrition, and recovery strategies to optimize energy, endurance, and adaptation.

Core Principles

Athletic nutrition aims to match energy intake with output — providing the right fuel at the right time.

1. Fuel for performance → Carbs before and during exercise.
2. Recover efficiently → Protein + carbs after training.
3. Adapt over time → Periodize intake with training load (carb cycling).
4. Stay hydrated → Replace fluids and electrolytes lost in sweat.

Carb Cycling Explained

Carb cycling adjusts carbohydrate intake based on training intensity and recovery needs.

- Day Type: High-intensity / competition | Goal: Maximize performance | Carb Intake (per kg): 5–7 g/kg | Example Focus: High-carb meals and snacks
- Day Type: Moderate training | Goal: Support energy, recovery | Carb Intake (per kg): 3–5 g/kg | Example Focus: Balanced intake through the day
- Day Type: Rest / light training | Goal: Aid recovery, avoid excess | Carb Intake (per kg): 2–3 g/kg | Example Focus: Focus on protein, healthy fats, veggies

 Adjust fats inversely to carbs: higher carbs → lower fats, and vice versa.

Pre-Workout Nutrition

Goal: Optimize energy and focus for performance.

- Timing: 2–3 hrs before | Focus: Carbs + lean protein | Example Meals: Rice with chicken and veggies, oatmeal with whey and banana
- Timing: 30–60 min before | Focus: Quick-digesting carbs | Example Meals: Banana, sports drink, rice cakes

 Avoid high-fat or high-fiber meals right before training to prevent GI distress.

Intra-Workout Fuel

Goal: Sustain energy and delay fatigue during long or intense sessions.

- Duration: <60 min | Recommendation: Water is sufficient
- Duration: 60–90 min | Recommendation: 30–45 g carbs/hour (e.g., sports drink, gels, or chews)
- Duration: >90 min | Recommendation: 45–75 g carbs/hour + electrolytes

 Combine glucose + fructose sources for better absorption.
 Maintain fluid intake: ~500–1000 ml/hour depending on sweat rate.

Post-Workout Recovery

Goal: Replenish glycogen and rebuild muscle.

- Nutrient: Carbs | Recommendation: 1.0–1.5 g per kg (within 1–2 hrs) | Example: Rice, pasta, oats, fruit
- Nutrient: Protein | Recommendation: 20–40 g high-quality | Example: Whey shake, chicken, eggs
- Nutrient: Fluids | Recommendation: 1.5x fluid lost in training | Example: Water + electrolytes

 Add a bit of sodium to meals/drinks to improve rehydration.

Recovery Enhancers

- Strategy: Sleep (7–9 hrs) | Benefit: Boosts hormone balance and muscle repair.
- Strategy: Omega-3s | Benefit: Reduce inflammation and aid recovery.
- Strategy: Antioxidant-rich foods | Benefit: Support immune function (berries, spinach, beets).
- Strategy: Magnesium & electrolytes | Benefit: Prevent cramps and promote relaxation.

Key Takeaways

1. Periodize carbs — fuel hard on hard days, rest on light ones.
2. Pre- and post-workout meals are non-negotiable for athletes.
3. Stay hydrated and electrolyte-balanced before, during, and after sessions.
4. Recovery = training + nutrition + sleep.
5. Small daily habits add up — consistency beats intensity.

Added Notes:
- For ultra-endurance events, combine solid and liquid carbs to maintain gut comfort.
- Sodium replacement: 300–800 mg per hour in hot conditions.
- Aim for ~1.2 g protein/kg/day minimum even during taper or rest weeks.
- Periodize hydration strategies with climate and event duration.
