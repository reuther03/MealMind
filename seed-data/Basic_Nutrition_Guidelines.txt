# Basic Nutrition Guidelines

A simple evidence-based reference for daily nutrition, including protein, fats, and carbohydrate needs — split by
activity level.

General Principles

- Calories determine body weight changes:
    - Surplus → gain weight / muscle
    - Deficit → lose weight / fat
- Macronutrients (protein, carbs, fat) determine how that weight changes.
- Micronutrients (vitamins, minerals, fiber, etc.) determine how healthy you are while changing it.

Protein

- Category: Sedentary / average person | Recommended Intake: 0.8–1.0 g per kg of body mass | Purpose: Maintains muscle and tissue health
- Category: Active person / recreational exercise | Recommended Intake: 1.2–1.6 g per kg | Purpose: Supports recovery and muscle maintenance
- Category: Strength or hypertrophy training | Recommended Intake: 1.6–2.2 g per kg | Purpose: Maximizes muscle growth and repair
- Category: Cutting phase (fat loss) | Recommended Intake: 2.0–2.4 g per kg | Purpose: Preserves lean mass under calorie deficit

 Aim to spread protein across 3–5 meals per day.
 Prefer complete protein sources: eggs, meat, fish, dairy, soy, or blended plant proteins.

Fats

- Category: General health | Recommended Intake: 0.8–1.0 g per kg | Purpose: Hormone production, brain health
- Category: Athletes / strength training | Recommended Intake: 0.6–1.0 g per kg | Purpose: Energy and nutrient absorption
- Category: Cutting phase | Recommended Intake: 0.5–0.8 g per kg | Purpose: Lower fat to save calories, but not below 0.5 g/kg

 Focus on unsaturated fats (olive oil, avocados, nuts, fatty fish).
 Limit trans fats and excessive processed vegetable oils.

Carbohydrates

- Category: Sedentary / light activity | Recommended Intake: 2–3 g per kg | Purpose: Baseline energy and brain function
- Category: Moderate exercise (3–5x/week) | Recommended Intake: 3–5 g per kg | Purpose: Energy for training and recovery
- Category: Heavy training or endurance | Recommended Intake: 5–7 g per kg | Purpose: Primary fuel for performance and glycogen replenishment

 Prefer complex carbs (rice, oats, whole grains, fruit, veggies).
 Adjust carb intake depending on training intensity and calorie goals.

Micronutrients & Hydration

- Category: Water | Recommendation: ~30–40 ml per kg of body mass daily (e.g. 2–3 L for most adults)
- Category: Sodium / electrolytes | Recommendation: Don’t restrict unless medically necessary, especially if sweating a lot
- Category: Fiber | Recommendation: 25–35 g per day
- Category: Vitamins & minerals | Recommendation: Eat diverse fruits, vegetables, and whole foods daily

Supplement only if deficient (common: vitamin D, magnesium, omega-3, B12 for vegetarians).

Example for a 75 kg Person

- Category: Protein | Sedentary: 75 g | Strength Training: 150 g
- Category: Fats | Sedentary: 65 g | Strength Training: 70 g
- Category: Carbs | Sedentary: 200 g | Strength Training: 350 g
- Category: Calories (approx.) | Sedentary: 2000 kcal | Strength Training: 2700–2900 kcal

Key Takeaways

1. Prioritize protein for body composition.
2. Balance fats for hormones and brain health.
3. Adjust carbs to match activity and energy demands.
4. Hydrate well, eat colorful plants, and sleep enough.
5. Consistency > perfection.

Added Notes:
- Protein quality matters: aim for ~2–3 g leucine per meal (≈25–35 g high-quality protein) to stimulate muscle protein synthesis.
- Carbohydrate timing: place a larger share of carbs around training to support performance and recovery; reduce late at night if appetite control is an issue.
- Alcohol: each standard drink (~14 g alcohol ≈ 100–150 kcal) displaces recovery and increases appetite; limit especially on training days.
- Minimum produce target: 400–800 g/day of fruits and vegetables supports micronutrient sufficiency and fiber.
- Salt to taste unless medically contraindicated; heavy sweaters may benefit from 1–3 g additional sodium on long, hot training days.
