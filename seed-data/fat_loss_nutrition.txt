Fat Loss Nutrition

A practical, evidence-based guide to losing fat through a calorie deficit, managing hunger and satiety, and avoiding common dieting mistakes.

The Goal: Sustainable Calorie Deficit

Fat loss occurs only when you consistently consume fewer calories than you burn. The aim is a moderate, sustainable deficit — not starvation.

- Goal: Moderate (recommended) | Calorie Deficit: 15–25% below maintenance | Expected Fat Loss: 0.5–1.0% of body weight per week
- Goal: Aggressive (short term) | Calorie Deficit: 25–35% below maintenance | Expected Fat Loss: Faster loss, higher fatigue & muscle risk

 Small, steady progress preserves muscle and energy.
 Extreme restriction often leads to rebound weight gain.

Macronutrient Ratios
Protein
- 2.0–2.4 g per kg body weight
- Preserves lean muscle during deficit, improves satiety.
Fats
- 0.5–0.8 g per kg body weight
- Supports hormones and brain function.
Carbohydrates
- 2–4 g per kg body weight (adjust to activity)
- Fuels training performance and recovery.

 Keep protein high, moderate carbs, and control fats for calorie flexibility.

Managing Hunger & Satiety

- Strategy: Eat high-volume foods | Description: Focus on vegetables, soups, fruit, and lean proteins.
- Strategy: Prioritize protein | Description: Slows digestion and keeps you full longer.
- Strategy: Drink water regularly | Description: Dehydration can feel like hunger.
- Strategy: Choose whole foods | Description: Fiber and low energy density improve fullness.
- Strategy: Sleep 7–9 hours | Description: Lack of sleep increases appetite hormones (ghrelin).

 Slow eating and mindful meals also reduce overeating.

Common Pitfalls

- Mistake: Overestimating calorie burn | Consequence: Slower fat loss | Fix: Track food intake and activity honestly.
- Mistake: Cutting calories too low | Consequence: Fatigue, muscle loss | Fix: Keep deficit moderate; maintain protein.
- Mistake: Neglecting strength training | Consequence: Muscle loss, slower metabolism | Fix: Lift weights 2–4x/week.
- Mistake: Weekend overeating | Consequence: Erases weekly deficit | Fix: Track consistently, even on weekends.
- Mistake: Overreliance on supplements | Consequence: Wasted money | Fix: Prioritize real food and proper sleep.

Pre- and Post-Workout Nutrition (in Deficit)

- Timing: Pre-workout | Focus: Energy & focus | Example: Banana, Greek yogurt, coffee
- Timing: Post-workout | Focus: Recovery | Example: Whey + fruit; chicken + rice

 Keep workouts fueled to preserve muscle and strength.

Example Day (2000 kcal)

- Meal: Breakfast | Example: Scrambled eggs, toast, spinach | Calories: 400
- Meal: Snack | Example: Protein shake + apple | Calories: 200
- Meal: Lunch | Example: Chicken breast, quinoa, veggies | Calories: 500
- Meal: Snack | Example: Greek yogurt + berries | Calories: 200
- Meal: Dinner | Example: Salmon, broccoli, sweet potato | Calories: 550
- Meal: Total | Example: — | Calories: ~1850–2000 kcal

Key Takeaways

1. Fat loss = consistent calorie deficit, not short-term restriction.
2. High protein + fiber diets make staying full easier.
3. Keep training hard to maintain muscle and metabolism.
4. Don’t fear carbs — balance them around activity.
5. Track progress (weight, photos, strength) and adjust every 2–3 weeks.

Added Notes:
- Adherence tactics: pre-log meals, keep high-protein snacks ready, and use consistent meal times to reduce decision fatigue.
- Diet breaks and refeeds: brief returns to maintenance or single high-carb days can improve training quality; they do not 'reset' metabolism but may aid adherence.
- Resistance training is non-negotiable during cuts; aim for 6–12 hard sets per muscle per week and maintain loads.
- Sleep: prioritize 7–9 hours; short sleep increases hunger and reduces fat loss efficiency.
- Alcohol: count it; it impairs recovery and increases untracked snacking.
