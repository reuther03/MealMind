# Common Nutritional Deficiencies

A reference guide to the **most frequent nutrient deficiencies**, how to **recognize their symptoms**, and **address them through diet or supplementation**.

---

##  Why Deficiencies Happen

Even balanced diets can fall short on key nutrients due to:
- Limited food variety or restrictive diets (e.g., vegan, keto)  
- Poor digestion or absorption issues  
- Low sunlight exposure or seasonal changes  
- Increased demand (training, stress, illness)

##  Most Common Deficiencies

###  **1. Vitamin D**
| Aspect | Details |
|---------|----------|
| **Function** | Bone health, immune system, hormone regulation |
| **Deficiency Signs** | Fatigue, low mood, weak immunity, muscle weakness |
| **Food Sources** | Fatty fish, eggs, fortified dairy/plant milk |
| **Supplementation** | 1,000–2,000 IU/day (up to 4,000 IU in winter) |
| **Extra Tip** | 15–30 min sunlight exposure helps maintain levels |

| **Deficiency Signs** | Fatigue, tingling hands/feet, brain fog |
| **Food Sources** | Meat, fish, eggs, dairy |
| **Vegan Sources** | Fortified plant milk, nutritional yeast, supplements |
| **Supplementation** | 250–500 mcg/week (cyanocobalamin or methylcobalamin) |

---

###  **5. Calcium**
| Aspect | Details |
|---------|----------|
| **Function** | Bone and teeth strength, muscle contraction, nerve signaling |
| **Deficiency Signs** | Brittle nails, weak bones, cramps |
| **Food Sources** | Dairy, tofu, fortified milk, leafy greens, sardines |
| **Supplementation** | 500–1000 mg/day (split doses; better with vitamin D) |

---

| **Deficiency Signs** | Hair loss, poor healing, low appetite, low immunity |
| **Food Sources** | Meat, shellfish, pumpkin seeds, chickpeas |
| **Supplementation** | 10–20 mg/day (with food; avoid high chronic intake) |

---

###  **7. Omega-3 Fatty Acids (EPA/DHA)**

| **Deficiency Signs** | Dry skin, joint stiffness, poor mood, brain fog |
| **Food Sources** | Salmon, mackerel, sardines, chia, flaxseed |
| **Supplementation** | 1–3 g combined EPA + DHA per day |

---

###  **8. Folate (Vitamin B9)**
| Aspect | Details |
|---------|----------|
| **Function** | DNA synthesis, red blood cell formation |
| **Deficiency Signs** | Fatigue, weakness, anemia |
| **Food Sources** | Leafy greens, lentils, citrus fruits, asparagus |
| **Supplementation** | 400 mcg/day (especially for pregnancy) |

---

##  Testing & Diagnosis

| Method | What It Shows |
|--------|----------------|
| **Blood test (basic panel)** | Vitamin D, iron, calcium, magnesium |
| **Advanced test** | Omega-3 index, zinc, B vitamins, hormone markers |
| **Symptoms-based check** | Useful for early detection before testing |

 Always confirm suspected deficiencies with lab tests before supplementing heavily.

---

##  Prevention & Long-Term Strategies

1. Eat a **diverse diet** rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, nuts, and protein.  
2. Include **fortified foods** if on a restricted diet (vegan, vegetarian).  
3. Get **regular sunlight exposure** and maintain hydration.  
4. **Rotate food choices** to cover all micronutrients.  
5. Retest every **6–12 months** if supplementing long term.

---

##  Key Takeaways

- Deficiencies are common even in developed diets — prevention is easier than correction.  
- Combine **whole foods + smart supplementation** for balance.  
- Track symptoms, get bloodwork, and adjust intelligently.  
- Nutrient synergy matters — e.g., **Vitamin D + Calcium**, **Iron + Vitamin C**.  
- The goal: **optimal nutrition**, not just “not deficient.”
