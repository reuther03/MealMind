#  Muscle Gain Nutrition

A practical guide to building muscle through a structured **caloric surplus**, balanced **macronutrient ratios**, and consistent **meal planning**.

---

##  The Goal: Controlled Surplus

To gain lean muscle, you need a **caloric surplus** — eating slightly more calories than your body burns.

| Goal | Surplus | Expected Weight Gain |
|------|----------|----------------------|
| **Beginner** | +300–500 kcal/day | 0.5–1.0 kg/month |
| **Intermediate/Advanced** | +200–300 kcal/day | 0.25–0.5 kg/month |

 Slow, steady gain = more muscle, less fat.  
 Large surpluses often lead to excessive fat gain.

##  Macronutrient Ratios

###  **Protein**
- **1.6–2.2 g per kg body weight**
- Builds and repairs muscle tissue.

###  **Carbohydrates**
- **4–6 g per kg body weight**
- Primary energy source for intense training.

###  **Fats**
- **0.8–1.0 g per kg body weight**
- Supports hormones, brain function, and recovery.

###  Example (for 75 kg person)
| Nutrient | Amount | Calories |
|-----------|---------|-----------|
| Protein | 150 g | 600 kcal |
| Carbs | 375 g | 1500 kcal |
| Fats | 70 g | 630 kcal |
| **Total** | — | **~2730 kcal/day** |

##  Meal Timing & Frequency

| Time | Focus | Example Meal |
|------|--------|---------------|
| **Breakfast** | Carbs + protein | Oats, milk, banana, whey |
| **Lunch** | Balanced meal | Rice, chicken, veggies, olive oil |
| **Pre-workout** | Energy + easy digestion | Rice cakes, fruit, yogurt |
| **Post-workout** | Recovery meal | Whey shake + banana |
| **Dinner** | Protein + complex carbs | Salmon, sweet potato, broccoli |
| **Snack (optional)** | Calorie top-up | Nuts, cottage cheese, smoothie |

 Spread protein across 3–5 meals/day.  
 Eat a carb-heavy meal before and after workouts.

---

##  Food Quality Matters

- Choose **whole, nutrient-dense foods** (meat, fish, grains, fruit, dairy, nuts).  
- Use **liquid calories** (smoothies, milk, shakes) if appetite is low.  
- Avoid excessive junk food — quality matters for recovery and health.

---

##  Tracking & Adjustments

1. Track your **body weight** 2–3× per week (morning, fasted).  
2. If you’re not gaining → increase calories by **150–200 kcal/day**.  
3. If you’re gaining too quickly (>1 kg/week) → reduce by **200–300 kcal/day**.  
4. Reassess every 2–3 weeks.

##  Example 1-Day Muscle Gain Plan (2700 kcal)

| Meal | Example | Calories |
|------|----------|-----------|
| **Breakfast** | Oats with milk, berries, whey, almonds | 600 |
| **Snack** | Greek yogurt with banana | 300 |
| **Lunch** | Chicken, rice, olive oil, veggies | 650 |
| **Post-Workout** | Whey shake + banana | 250 |
| **Dinner** | Salmon, potatoes, broccoli | 600 |
| **Snack (before bed)** | Cottage cheese + peanut butter | 300 |
| **Total** | — | **~2700 kcal** |

##  Key Takeaways

1. Eat in a **small, consistent surplus** (200–500 kcal above maintenance).  
2. **Prioritize protein and carbs** for muscle growth.  
3. Train progressively — nutrition amplifies training, not replaces it.  
4. Track progress and adjust intake as you adapt.  
5. Sleep, hydration, and recovery are equally critical for muscle gain.
