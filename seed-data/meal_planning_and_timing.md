## ⏱️ Why Meal Timing Matters

Meal timing isn’t just about eating at set hours — it’s about **fueling your body strategically** to match your energy demands and recovery needs.

- **Frequent meals (3–5/day)** help regulate hunger and energy.
- **Protein timing** supports continuous muscle repair.
- **Carbohydrate timing** improves training performance and glycogen recovery.
- **Balanced distribution** of calories prevents overeating late in the day.

## 🍔 General Meal Structure

| Meal | Timing | Focus | Example |
|------|---------|--------|----------|
| **Breakfast** | Within 1–2 hrs after waking | Protein + complex carbs + fiber | Oats with whey protein, banana, and nuts |
| **Lunch** | 4–5 hrs after breakfast | Balanced macros + vegetables | Rice with chicken breast, olive oil, and salad |
| **Dinner** | 4–5 hrs after lunch | Protein + veggies + healthy fats | Salmon with quinoa and spinach |
| **Snacks (optional)** | Between meals | Protein or fruit-based | Greek yogurt, boiled eggs, apple with peanut butter |

✅ **Tip:** Eat every 3–5 hours to maintain energy and stable blood sugar.

## 🏋️ Pre-Workout Nutrition

**Goal:** Maximize energy and endurance during training.

| Timing | Macronutrient Focus | Example Meals |
|---------|---------------------|----------------|
| **2–3 hrs before** | Balanced meal with carbs, protein, low fat | Chicken with rice and veggies; oatmeal with berries and whey |
| **30–60 min before (optional)** | Quick carbs, low fat/fiber | Banana, rice cakes, small smoothie |

✅ Include **easily digestible carbs** and **moderate protein**.  
❌ Avoid high fat or heavy meals right before exercise.

## 🏃 Post-Workout Nutrition

**Goal:** Rebuild muscle and replenish glycogen.

| Timing | Macronutrient Focus | Example Meals |
|---------|---------------------|----------------|
| **Within 30–90 min** | Fast-digesting protein + carbs | Whey shake + banana; rice with tuna; eggs + toast |

✅ Aim for **20–40 g of protein** and **1–1.5 g carbs/kg body weight** after training.  
⚠️ Don’t skip post-workout meals — it slows recovery.
