#  Meal Planning & Timing

A practical guide to **structuring meals across the day**, optimizing **pre- and post-workout nutrition**, and creating **balanced daily meal plans** for energy, recovery, and health.

##  Why Meal Timing Matters

Meal timing isn’t just about eating at set hours — it’s about **fueling your body strategically** to match your energy demands and recovery needs.

- **Frequent meals (3–5/day)** help regulate hunger and energy.
- **Protein timing** supports continuous muscle repair.
- **Carbohydrate timing** improves training performance and glycogen recovery.
- **Balanced distribution** of calories prevents overeating late in the day.

##  General Meal Structure

| Meal | Timing | Focus | Example |
|------|---------|--------|----------|
| **Breakfast** | Within 1–2 hrs after waking | Protein + complex carbs + fiber | Oats with whey protein, banana, and nuts |
| **Lunch** | 4–5 hrs after breakfast | Balanced macros + vegetables | Rice with chicken breast, olive oil, and salad |
| **Dinner** | 4–5 hrs after lunch | Protein + veggies + healthy fats | Salmon with quinoa and spinach |
| **Snacks (optional)** | Between meals | Protein or fruit-based | Greek yogurt, boiled eggs, apple with peanut butter |

 **Tip:** Eat every 3–5 hours to maintain energy and stable blood sugar.

##  Pre-Workout Nutrition

**Goal:** Maximize energy and endurance during training.

| Timing | Macronutrient Focus | Example Meals |
|---------|---------------------|----------------|
| **2–3 hrs before** | Balanced meal with carbs, protein, low fat | Chicken with rice and veggies; oatmeal with berries and whey |
| **30–60 min before (optional)** | Quick carbs, low fat/fiber | Banana, rice cakes, small smoothie |

 Include **easily digestible carbs** and **moderate protein**.  
 Avoid high fat or heavy meals right before exercise.

---

##  Post-Workout Nutrition

**Goal:** Rebuild muscle and replenish glycogen.

| Timing | Macronutrient Focus | Example Meals |
|---------|---------------------|----------------|
| **Within 30–90 min** | Fast-digesting protein + carbs | Whey shake + banana; rice with tuna; eggs + toast |

 Aim for **20–40 g of protein** and **1–1.5 g carbs/kg body weight** after training.  
 Don’t skip post-workout meals — it slows recovery.

##  Practical Tips

1. **Plan ahead** – Prep ingredients or cook in batches.  
2. **Front-load calories** if training early, or **back-load** if training later.  
3. **Stay flexible** – it’s consistency that matters most.  
4. **Hydrate** throughout the day (30–40 ml/kg body weight).  
5. Adjust portion sizes as goals or activity levels change.

##  Key Takeaways

- Distribute protein evenly (20–40 g/meal).  
- Match carb intake to **training times**.  
- Avoid skipping meals; it leads to poor recovery or overeating later.  
- Meal timing fine-tunes performance, but total daily intake remains the priority.
