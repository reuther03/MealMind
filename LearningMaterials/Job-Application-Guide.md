## 7. Interview Preparation

### Common Questions You'll Get

#### 1. "Tell me about yourself"
**Bad answer:** "I'm a student looking for my first job..."

**Good answer:**
```
I'm an engineering student specializing in backend development with .NET.
I'm passionate about clean code and modern architecture patterns like DDD
and CQRS. Currently, I'm working on MealMind - a modular nutrition tracking
platform with AI chat capabilities using RAG. I've also completed two other
projects: EduSchedu (school management system) and TaskManager (task tracking
app), both using Clean Architecture and Modular Monolith patterns. I'm looking
for my first commercial role where I can apply what I've learned and continue
growing as a developer.
```

**Why it works:**
- Confident opener
- Highlights technical skills
- Shows active development
- Demonstrates learning mindset
- Clear about career goals

---

#### 2. "Tell me about your MealMind project"

**Structure your answer (2-3 minutes):**

**Part 1 - What it is:**
```
MealMind is a modular nutrition tracking platform with an AI-powered chat
assistant. Users can set nutrition goals, track their intake, and get
personalized advice through a conversational AI interface.
```

**Part 2 - Why you built it:**
```
I wanted to combine my interest in nutrition with learning modern backend
architectures and AI technologies. It was also an opportunity to work with
RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) and understand how to build context-aware
AI applications.
```

**Part 3 - Technical highlights:**
```
The application uses Clean Architecture with three modules: Identity, Nutrition,
and AiChat. The AI chat module implements RAG using PostgreSQL's pgvector
extension to store 768-dimensional embeddings. When users ask questions, the
system performs semantic search to find relevant nutrition information and
provides context to the LLM. I'm using Ollama for local LLM inference to keep
costs down and learn how these systems work.
```

**Part 4 - Challenges faced:**
```
One interesting challenge was figuring out the optimal chunking strategy for
RAG documents. I researched different approaches - fixed-size chunks vs semantic
chunking - and implemented a hybrid approach that respects document structure
while maintaining overlap to preserve context.
```

**Part 5 - What you'd improve:**
```
If I had more time, I'd add a comprehensive test suite, implement a frontend
UI, and deploy it to Azure. I'd also like to add integration with food databases
like OpenFoodFacts.
```

---

#### 3. "What's the difference between your projects?"

Show progression:

**TaskManager (07-08/2024):**
- Learning project
- Basic CRUD operations
- First time implementing DDD concepts
- Simple architecture

**EduSchedu (08/2024-Present):**
- More complex domain
- Applied Clean Architecture properly
- Modular Monolith structure
- Better understanding of DDD

**MealMind (10/2024-Present):**
- Most advanced
- Added CQRS pattern
- AI/ML integration
- Vector embeddings and semantic search
- Docker containerization
- Cross-module communication

**Key message:** "Each project helped me learn and apply more advanced concepts."

---

#### 4. "What do you know about Clean Architecture?"

**Good answer:**
```
Clean Architecture is an architectural pattern that emphasizes separation of
concerns and dependency inversion. The core idea is that business logic should
be independent of external concerns like databases, UI, or frameworks.

In my projects, I organize code into layers:
- Domain layer: Business entities, value objects, domain events
- Application layer: Use cases, commands, queries (CQRS)
- Infrastructure layer: Database access, external services
- API layer: Controllers, endpoints

Dependencies always point inward - the domain doesn't know about infrastructure,
which makes the code testable and maintainable.
```

---

#### 5. "What's CQRS and why did you use it?"

**Good answer:**
```
CQRS stands for Command Query Responsibility Segregation. It separates read
operations (queries) from write operations (commands).

In MealMind, I use MediatR to implement CQRS:
- Commands: Create user profile, add nutrition target, attach document
- Queries: Get user profile, get conversation messages, search documents

Benefits:
- Clear separation of concerns
- Commands can focus on business rules and validation
- Queries can be optimized for reading without affecting write models
- Makes the codebase easier to understand and maintain

For example, AddNutritionTargetCommand handles validation, creates the entity,
and publishes domain events. Meanwhile, GetUserProfileQuery just retrieves data
without any side effects.
```

---

#### 6. "What's RAG and how does it work in your project?"

**Good answer:**
```
RAG stands for Retrieval-Augmented Generation. It's a technique to give LLMs
access to specific knowledge without retraining them.

In MealMind, here's how it works:

1. Document Processing:
   - I split nutrition documents into chunks (500-800 tokens)
   - Generate 768-dimensional embeddings for each chunk using Ollama
   - Store chunks and embeddings in PostgreSQL with pgvector

2. Query Processing:
   - User asks a question like "How much protein do I need?"
   - System generates an embedding for the question
   - Performs cosine similarity search to find relevant chunks

3. Generation:
   - Top 3-5 relevant chunks are included as context
   - LLM receives: system prompt + retrieved context + user question
   - LLM generates response based on this combined information

This allows the AI to give accurate, specific nutrition advice without hallucinating.
```

---

#### 7. "Why should we hire you for this position?"

**Good answer:**
```
I believe I'm a good fit because:

1. Technical Foundation: I have hands-on experience with the technologies you
   use - C#, .NET Core, PostgreSQL, and modern architectural patterns.

2. Learning Ability: My projects show progression - from basic CRUD apps to
   implementing advanced concepts like RAG and AI integration. I'm constantly
   learning and applying new concepts.

3. Problem-Solving: Building MealMind required solving complex problems like
   chunking strategies, vector embeddings, and cross-module communication. I
   enjoy diving deep into technical challenges.

4. Best Practices: I don't just write code that works - I focus on Clean
   Architecture, DDD, and maintainable code because I understand these patterns
   make a difference in real projects.

5. Motivation: I'm eager to learn from experienced developers and contribute
   to commercial projects. I'm looking for a team where I can grow while adding
   value.
```

---

#### 8. "What are your weaknesses?"

**Bad answer:** "I'm a perfectionist" (clich√©)

**Good answer:**
```
One area I'm working on is frontend development. I'm very comfortable with
backend and APIs, but I want to strengthen my frontend skills. I understand
the basics of React and how frontend communicates with backend, but I'd like
to gain more hands-on experience building user interfaces.

Another area is production deployment and DevOps. While I use Docker for local
development, I haven't deployed a production application to the cloud yet. I'm
excited to learn about CI/CD pipelines, monitoring, and cloud services like Azure.

The positive side is I'm aware of these gaps and actively working to improve them.
```

---

#### 9. "Do you have any questions for us?"

**Always ask questions!** It shows interest and helps you evaluate the company.

**Good questions:**
```
1. "What does the onboarding process look like for junior developers?"
   (Shows you're thinking about success)

2. "What technologies and patterns does your team use? How is code review done?"
   (Shows you care about learning and code quality)

3. "What does a typical project look like? Are there opportunities to work on
   different parts of the codebase?"
   (Shows interest in diverse experience)

4. "How does the team approach learning and professional development?"
   (Shows long-term thinking)

5. "What are the biggest technical challenges the team is facing right now?"
   (Shows curiosity about real work)
```

**Avoid these questions in first interview:**
- Salary (wait until they bring it up or second interview)
- Benefits/vacation (wait until later stages)
- "What does your company do?" (research beforehand!)
